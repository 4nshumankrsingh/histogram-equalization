# ðŸ“· Image Enhancement Using Histogram Equalization
This project explores and implements advanced techniques for improving image quality using histogram equalization, a fundamental method in digital image processing. The work focuses on enhancing contrast in low-light or low-contrast images while preserving details, minimizing noise, and preventing over-enhancement.
